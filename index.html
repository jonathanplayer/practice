<p>Hi. My name is Jonathan Player and this is my practice site. As I contemplate how to design these pages, my imagnation leads me to believe it'll be easier to simply write out the information I want to display and then format it with code as I learn. From what I have seen, programmers tend to throw up the structure of code they intend to use and then populate the fields. My mind seems to freeze up when I attempt that. So I am going to play around (as I learn) with the idea of building code around the text I write first. Actually, I will pose a question to you readers. "What would you like to see me build?" There will come a day when I'm ready to make my own games and programs (which of course are an entirely different thing and use programming languages), but for practice in site building, I think I'd like to just meet your web challenges. So I will first build a submission field for you to send me your suggestions. (Though, at this time I have only started learning html and have no clue about css and javascript yet)
</p>

<p>Well, I can't sleep. So I'm guessing it's "attempt to blog" time. I think a ton. If I could simply record my thoughts as they flow, I wonder if that'd be grand. There's a sort of disconnect even between my thoughts and speaking up. How much more so in the process of trying to type it all out. But that's what I keep imagining to endeavor so here I am. Just writing mess in the dark until I get to something meaningful. The course I am following has reached the css phase. So perhaps I could start adding html to this site, but I just don't feel like it yet. There's nothing here to format so why bother. Maybe I'll follow the instructions to publish this so that it's out there and I can no longer hide.
</p>

<p>...One ramshackle babystep at a time. How many mistakes did I make to even get this text to appear? Over 15. And I added the paragraph formatting. Trying to use the websites and desktop apps for GitHub and Visual Studio Code at the same time as barely remembering the actual coding lessons is both stressful and exactly how I seem to like to do things. No clue what I'm doing next, but at least you can see this now.

<p>I thought I'd have more to rant about. Seems, I just want to continue the lessons. If I finish through the javascript portion and still don't want to decorate this site more, I'll probably jump right into a programming language so that then I'll have little projects to share and build the site around those. And yes, I know the colors I'm picking for things don't make sense, but I'm just making sure the tags work.
