                I am trying to set up for myself a bible-reading environment that removes the things I find distracting. It's been an idea I've worked on sporadically for years and I have a lot more work done in various apps and documents. I think this is where I would like to consolidate the efforts, but it'll probably be all done from scratch again. Right now the pages and text is basic, but I'll eventually design it to look more like my favored web novel style of reading.
