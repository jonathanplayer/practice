Hi. My name is Jonathan Player and this is my practice site. As I contemplate how to design these pages, my imagnation leads me to believe it'll be easier to simply write out the information I want to display and then format it with code as I learn. From what I have seen, programmers tend to throw up the structure of code they intend to use and then populate the fields. My mind seems to freeze up when I attempt that. So I am going to play around (as I learn) with the idea of building code around the text I write first. Actually, I will pose a question to you readers. "What would you like to see me build?" There will come a day when I'm ready to make my own games and programs, but for practice, I think I'd like to just meet your challenges. So I will first build a submission field for you to send me your suggestions. (Though, at this time I have only started learning html and have no clue about css and javascript yet - 5/26/21)

5/29/21 Well, I can't sleep. So I'm guessing it's "attempt to blog" time. I think a ton. If I could simply record my thoughts as they flow, I wonder if that'd be grand. There's a sort of disconnect even between my thoughts and speaking up. How much more so in the process of trying to type it all out. But that's what I keep imagining to endeavor so here I am. Just writing mess in the dark until I get to something meaningful. The course I am following has reached the css phase. So perhaps I could start adding html to this site, but I just don't feel like it yet. There's nothing here to format so why bother. Maybe I'll follow the instructions to publish this so that it's out there and I can no longer hide.
